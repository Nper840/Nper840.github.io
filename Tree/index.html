<h3>Welcome!</h3>
<p>Trees are incredibly important in nature: they clean the air, they provide homes and environments for millions of creatures and they provide us with natural beauty. But they also play a vital role in the new modern cities and suburbs that we now live in.</p>

<br>

<p>This website is all about trees; their uses and their impact on the environment and our societies. </p>
